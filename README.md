# Neutrino-Hacks

## Experiments in Javascript with Neutrino

This is a boilerplate/ experiment with Neutrino and React. So far this is just following along some tutorials, e.g.: For a starting point 
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/using-neutrino-for-modern-javascript-development/ 
and then the React part from https://davidwalsh.name/neutrino .
This was very helpful too: https://egghead.io/lessons/react-the-render-method .

## Installation

Check out [this repository](https://github.com/schafeld/Neutrino-Hacks), go to root folder and type `yarn install` or `npm install`, I guess.

## Start-Up


`cd` into project root folder and type `yarn start`.

Visit `localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Developer Testing

Simply run `yarn test` in the root folder for some testing with Jest.
See `test/add.test.js` and `src/add.js` for simple unit testing example.
